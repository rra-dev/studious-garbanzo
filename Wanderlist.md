[@Secureworks](https://twitter.com/Secureworks)

just released a threat analysis regarding flaws our team found in [#AzureAD](https://twitter.com/hashtag/AzureAD?src=hashtag_click) Pass-through Authentication (PTA). [https://secureworks.com/research/azure-active-directory-pass-through-authentication-flaws…](https://t.co/EFLqih9OPP)

The flaws allow threat actors to: * Gather credentials * Login with invalid credentials * Conduct DoS attacks 1/3

How is this different from previous PTA exploits like [#AADInternals](https://twitter.com/hashtag/AADInternals?src=hashtag_click) PTASpy? * After the initial compromise of a PTA agent, the exploitation is remote * Exploitation can't be detected from the Azure portal or logs * Exploit is persistent 2/3

What can administrators do if they detect a compromised PTA agent? * Contact Microsoft support to remove the agent How to protect / prevent? * Treat all servers with PTA agent as Tier 0 3/3

```

Do you know Windows records most important events related to the boot process in a dedicated binary log? A history of hundreds of boots. I believe it’s cool [#DFIR](https://twitter.com/hashtag/DFIR?src=hashtag_click) artifact, but never seen any tool parsing it. So, I have written one in PowerShell. Enjoy:

The latest post in my [#OnDetection](https://twitter.com/hashtag/OnDetection?src=hashtag_click) series asks "what is a procedure". It seems that we all have trouble pinning down exactly what it is & as a result there are many definitions. I propose a precise definition building on the ideas developed in this series.

This series of [#Jupyter](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Jupyter?src=hashtag_click) [#Notebooks](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Notebooks?src=hashtag_click) is a VERY nice step-by-step intro to data science and machine learning. If you're just starting out - I recommend walking through these notebooks as a first primer Definitely a great [#100DaysOfMLCode](https://twitter.com/hashtag/100DaysOfMLCode?src=hashtag_click) project [https://github.com/rasbt/python-machine-learning-book-2nd-edition](https://t.co/RA7c8jgzNS)
