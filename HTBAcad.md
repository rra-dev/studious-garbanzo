> Given the problem
> ```
> 20 * ________+ ________ = 65535 
> ```
> _Why did you not think to change the operators?_
> **ANSWER:**
> I took the operators as constraints, but I did consider signage or using negative numbers. I pretty much stopped immediately because I new that there were infinite correct solutions so it was therefore a useless waste of time. I wanted to continue to move forward so I didn't bother.
> I am using the self reflection exercise to investigate myself.

> A problem is an emotional state. Without emotions, it is just a situation.

The "**learning** **pyramid**", sometimes referred to as the "cone of **learning**", developed by the National Training Laboratory, suggests that most students only remember about 10% of what they read from textbooks, but retain nearly 90% of what they learn through teaching others.

Sep 29, 2021What is the **learning** **pyramid**? The **learning** **pyramid**, also called the "cone of **learning**," is an education model theorizing that some teaching methods help students remember information more than others. To represent how much information students can recall, the model assigns each approach a percentage out of 100.

#### [Understanding The Learning Pyramid](https://www.edtechreview.in/trends-insights/insights/understanding-the-learning-pyramid/)

Sep 7, 2022The **Learning** **Pyramid's** representation is generally via percentages and discrete layers within a "**pyramid** of **learning**." It is generally divided into 10, 20, 30, 50, and 90 percent. Simply put, the **Learning** **Pyramid** is a theoretical educational model in that few teaching methods help students remember information more than others.

The **Learning** **Pyramid** indicates that **learning** through audio-visual methods will typically help you retain 20% of the information offered. This method of **learning** may integrate **learning** aids such as: Pictures Handouts Videos Flip charts Whiteboards Slide shows Audiotapes Projectors Multimedia 3D objects …and more

The **Learning** **Pyramid** clearly illustrates that active participation in the **learning** process results in a higher retention of **learning**. 5%: Lecture 10%: Reading 20%: Audio-Visual 30%: Demonstration 50%: Discussion 75%: Practice Doing 90%: Teaching Others Based on the research, the least effective method would be a lecture.

Feb 28, 2021The **learning** **pyramid** describes varying **learning**/teaching methodologies and the retention rates of information from these methodologies. For instance, if a teacher uses only a lecture method of instruction, their students will only retain 5% of the information.
